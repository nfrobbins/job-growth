        <p> Over the last year, jobs grew in 48 states, with the highest rates of growth in Idaho and Nevada. The percent change of people employed in non-farm jobs increased in every state except for Mississippi, where it stayed the same, and Rhode Island, where it decreased by half a percent.</p> 
        <p>Idaho seems to be the place to be for potential job seekers. Idaho leads the nation in job growth from October 2022 to 2023, with a 3.5 percent increase in non-farm jobs. Idaho ranks <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm">21st</a> in national unemployment, with an unemployment rate of 3.2 percent. The national unemployment rate in October 2023 was <a  href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/">3.9 percent.</a></p>
        <p>Idaho was one of the first states to recoup job losses from the Covid pandemic, said Sam Wolkenhauer, a regional economist for the Idaho Bureau of Labor, on its <a href ="https://idahoatwork.com/2022/01/10/employment-growth-projected-to-continue-in-idaho/">blog.</a> Leisure and hospitality is Idahoâ€™s fastest growing industry at a rate of 7.6 percent as it recovers from pandemic shutdowns.</p>

        <p>Nevada has the highest unemployment rate in the country at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm">5.4 percent.</a> But perhaps things are looking up for Nevadans: the state had the second-highest rate of job growth at 3.4 percent.</p>
        <p>In an <a href="https://www.nevadacurrent.com/2023/08/24/nvs-weird-paradox-highest-job-growth-but-highest-unemployment/">interview</a> with The Nevada Current, Nevada Department of Employment's chief economist David Schmidt attributes the high unemployment rates to the housing bust of the Great Recession, from which the state still struggles to recover.</p>
        <p>Schmidt says job growth can be accounted for by the fact that in Las Vegas, Nevada employs many people in the hospitality industry, which is growing for the first time since the pandemic.</p>
        <p> He calls the high unemployment rate combined with high job growth rates a "weird paradox."
